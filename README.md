## Install

### Install Docker and VSCode

Install these mandatory tools.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) has been correctly installed and available in PATH.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) has been correctly installed.

### Install VSCode Extension

Install [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) extension.

### Download and Extract

Download and extract the archive of this repository. Open the extracted directory with VSCode.
```bash
curl -o- -L https://github.com/pman0214/vscode_c-devcontainer/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz -O - | tar zxv
```

Instead, you can download the archive of this repository using a Web browser and extract the archive with any unarchiver.

## Usage

```bash
code vscode_c-devcontainer
```
Instead of running the above command, you can open VSCode from the windows/mac menu and run "File > Open Workspace..." to specify the extracted `vscode_c-devcontainer` directory.

You will be asked to reopen the folder in a remote container. Answer `Reopen in Conainer`.
If you mistakenly answered `Don't Show Again...`, then press `F1` to open the Command Palette and execute `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`.
You can also run `Reopen in Container` from the bottom left green button.
For the first time of `Reopen in Container`, it might take long time to build and start the docker container.

Now you are in a docker container. Write your C code, build the code, and run the compiled file on the integrated terminal.
Note that you can make subdirectories to put C source code files.

Build and run tasks are available.
Ctrl+Shift+B (Cmd+Shift+B on mac) to build, Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P on mac) and select `run` to run your code.

### To Stop

Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P on mac) to open command pallette and execute `Remote: Close Remote Connection`.
Open terminal on your windows (or mac) and execute `docker` command to stop your container.

First, lookup your container and specify container name.
```bash
% docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                   CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
b057de853547   gcc:14    "/bin/sh -c 'echo Coâ€¦"   2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes             agitated_shannon
```

In the above example, `agitated_shannon` is the name of your container.
```bash
% docker stop agitated_shannon
```

If you don't need the development environment anymore, you can remove the container.
```bash
% docker rm agitated_shannon
```
